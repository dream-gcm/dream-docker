**Purpose:** Instructions to download the Docker Desktop app, install it, and get the available Docker image that  provides an environment that is ready for the DREAM model to work.
Note that this Docker image is in open acces but  does not contain the model code itself, that should be downloaded through git (see the instructions below) if you are an authorized member of the group (otherwise please contact us). So you need to know your github identifiers before staring these instructions so that you can clone the model code  from the private github repository.

# 1 Install the Docker Desktop app 
_[These steps have to be done once for all.]_

Get and install the Docker Desktop app on your local machine:
* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
* There is a version for Mac OS, Linux and Windows plateform

# 2 Load the DREAM Docker image 
_[These steps have to be done once for all.]_
* Launch the Docker Desktop app. It opens a window that you can close. Docker will now run in the background and Docker command are available in your terminal.
* In a terminal, run the docker command below to download the DREAM Docker image on your local machine. It might take a while to download depending on your connexion.
```
docker pull  ghcr.io/dream-gcm/dreamgcm-env:latest
```
The long downloading  has to be done only once for all. Then it  will be kept  on your local machine and you can re-activate it anytime by running the Docker app and the Docker command in the terminal as explained below.

# 3. Download the DREAM model code
_[These steps have to be done once for all.]_

To avoid messing up with your local install of DREAM i suggest that you create a new directory `DREAM-latest-Docker` where you will download the model code from scratch as if you were a workshop attendant. Because the DREAM code repository is private you will need to enter your github id and password when cloning.
```
# create directory
mkdir DREAM-latest-Docker

# download the model code in this new directory with git
cd DREAM-latest-Docker
git clone https://github.com/dream-gcm/DREAM.git

# switch to my dev branch where the scripts have been prepared to work easily within the DOcker
git checkout dev-in-Docker
```

# 4. Run Docker
_[These steps have to be done each time you want to use the DREAM model.]_

* On your local machine, open the Docker Desktop app if not already open.
*  Then in a terminal, run the docker command below (edit first your-local-path-to-DREAM-latest-Docker/) .
```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v your-local-path-to-DREAM-latest-Docker/:/home/jovyan/work ghcr.io/dream-gcm/dreamgcm-env:latest jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
```
If it works you will have some text printed in the terminal saying that a server is running.

* Explanation of what this command does:
  * In this command, we tell Docker to run the Docker image “dreamgcm-env” from the GitHub website `ghcr.io/dream-gcm/dreamgcm-env` and inside the Docker,  run the JupyterLab  and   link port 8888 to the port inside the image to display the Jupyterlab.
  * **Importantly** we also link  the local directory on your machine where the DREAM code is (`your-local-path-to-DREAM-latest-Docker/`) to the virtual directory `/home/jovyan/work/` in the Docker image. Once in the Docker, you will work in `/home/jovyan/work/` but your actions will happen in `your-local-path-to-DREAM-latest-Docker/`.
  *  Copy the link that printed in the terminal that looks like  http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=…….  (But copy the entire link with the token with numbers)
  *  Paste this link in your favourite browser. It should open a JupyterLab window like this:
![_TODO: Insert screenshot_](Screenshot%202025-01-30%20at%2016.35.04.png)
  *  Click on the “Terminal” icon to open a terminal (this terminal runs in the Docker, with its associated environment). There you can start working in the model as usual, and your environnement is already ready to work with Fortran, netcdf, and all that.
  *  On the left, click on the “work” directory, then in DREAM directory, and you can see the files and subdirectories from the DREAM model code. You can open and edit those file within the JupyterLab too by clicking on them.

--> **IMPORTANT: In the following instructions, you will now only work WITHIN the Docker container accessible in the browser window (it will allow you to use a terminal, a notebook or a text editor, WITHIN that browser window).**




# 5. DREAM first steps

### 5.1 Set your environment file
```
cd work/DREAM/dream_model/jobs
```
`DREAMenv.sh`  is the config file  where you can modify the main settings of the various scripts. It will export various variables for later use by the other scripts. 
Note that whenever working from  the Docker, this config file should work as is, without any edits. The only thing you might want to  edit is the name of the experiment you want to work on (`EXPID`).
To edit this file, you can either do `vi DREAMenv.sh  ` or click and open from the directories on the left of the JupyerLab window.
- [ ] run it in the terminal as a first check:
```
./DREAMenv.sh TEST
```
It should gives you confirmation that everything is bon :

### 5.2 Compile libs

```
cd ~/work/DREAM/dream_model/source/lib/
./makelib_docker.csh 
```


### 5.3 Recompute basic state forcing and run a test simulation where nothing should happen
* ```cd ~/work/DREAM/dream_model/jobs```
* then run the model for 1 time-step with no perturbation:
```
./runmodel_v8.4_Docker.sh
# with edits in the script:
# KRUN=1
# RUNTYPE="TRAIN"
# LFAN=.F.
```

* then run the script to compute the forcing: ``` ./makefrc_Docker.sh```

* then run the model for several  days with no perturbation but using the forcing file (`LFAN=.F.`) in order to check that the model state does not change with time (the numbers printed on the screen should not change from one time step to the next (`Z(100) =   (-1.07608914865179765E-004,9.91382466921794322E-005) `):
```
./runmodel_v8.4_Docker.sh
# with edits in the script:
# KRUN=960
# RUNTYPE="PERPETUAL"
# LFAN=.F.
```

# 6 Run a perturbation simulation
* Run the model for several  days with the example perturbation provided with the code (I.e. `CPac_EQ180E_40x15_Deep_2dpd_fan.b`):

```
./runmodel_v8.4_Docker.sh
# with edits in the script:
# KRUN=960
# RUNTYPE="PERPETUAL"
# LFAN=.T.
# imposed forcing anomaly read into ZFAN etc - spectral
# ln  -s $DATADIRSP/fan/CPac_EQ180E_40x15_Deep_2dpd_fan.b  fort.15
```

* process outputs
```
cd ~/work/DREAM/dream_model/diagnostics/
./run_output.sh
```
The outputs of your new simulation are now available in `~/work/DREAM/dream_results/EXPID/netcdfs` where EXPID is the name you set in the config file: `~/work/DREAM/dream_model/jobs/DREAMenv.sh`  for your experiment (by default it is "TESTEXPEDOCKER". 

# 7 PLOT your results

Check out the dedicated notebook. [SLX: To be done.]

# 8 Close Docker 
* when you are done with your model session, you can close the Docker app and the terminal from which you had run the Docker command.
* next time you want to use the model, start the instructions at section 4 above.
